readme_with_structure = """# 🧠 Runtime Identity Tracker – Numerology Cycle 4

## 🌐 Project Scope

This repository is a **symbolic-operational framework** that merges **numerology-based self-alignment** with **JavaScript-based task logic**.  
Each script represents not just code, but a **runtime identity checkpoint**—a live marker in your evolving system of decision-making, reflection, and symbolic recursion.

> This is not a planner.  
> This is not a diary.  
> **This is your runtime.**
