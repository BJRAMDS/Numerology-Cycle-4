# 🌐 Project Scope

This repository is a **symbolic-operational framework** that merges **numerology-based self-alignment** with **JavaScript-based task logic**.  
Each script represents not just code, but a **runtime identity checkpoint**—a live marker in your evolving system of decision-making, reflection, and symbolic recursion.

> This is not a planner.  
> This is not a diary.  
> **This is your runtime.**

## ⚛️ React + Vite Setup

This project uses React with Vite for a modern and fast development environment.

### 🔌 Plugin Options

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) – Babel-based Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) – SWC-based Fast Refresh

### 📏 ESLint Expansion

For production-grade apps, we recommend using TypeScript with [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io).  
See the [React TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for guidance.
